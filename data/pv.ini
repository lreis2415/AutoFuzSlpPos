# TerrainAttrDict: Terrain attributes' name used to derive fuzzy slope position.
#                  1. Built-in keywords are RPI, ProfC, HorizC, Slp, HAND, and Elev (case-insensitive).
#                  2. Among them, regional attribute (such as RPI) is required and should be in the first place,
#                     and can be replaced by rpiFile(which MUST be defined before).
#                  3. Other user-defined terrain attributes should be FULL FILE PATH!
#                  4. Values are split by comma (,)
#                  5. e.g.1., TerrainAttrDict = RPI, ProfC, Slp, HAND
#                     e.g.2., TerrainAttrDict = rpiFile, ProfC, Slp, Elev
#                     e.g.3., TerrainAttrDict = RPI, ProfC, Slp, /home/path/to/another/attribute/*.tif
#
# XXXBaseParam: Base parameters, they are:
#                                        MIN_FREQUENCY: minimal frequency of frequency distribution of terrain attributes
#                                        MIN_TYPLOC_NUM_PECENT: mininal percent of selected typical locations in RPI range defined area
#                                        MAX_TYPLOC_NUM_PERCENT: maximum percent of selected typical locations in RPI range defined area
#                                        SELECTION_MODE: whether to satisfy the minimal prototype number (0) or maximum (1)

#                  2. More than one latter for an item is allowed, e.g., ZB
#                  3. The sequence should be consistent with TerrainAttrDict!
#
# XXXValueRanges: Value ranges of terrain attributes for extracting prototype of Ridge, Shoulder slope, Backslope, Footslope and valley.
#                  1. The basic format of a single value range is [TerrainAttrNo, value1, value2], e.g., [1, 0.99, 1.0] means for RPI the range is 0.99 ~ 1.0

#                  3. If AutoTypLocExtraction is False, and ModifyExtractConfFile is True,
#                     all value ranges are modified in configuration files, and do not need to modify here.
#                  4. If AutoTypLocExtraction is False, and ModifyExtractConfFile is False,
#                     all value ranges corresponding to TerrainAttrDict should be defined here,
