Dear all,
This is a small study area for testing AutoFuzSlpPos. The DEM data can be freely download from http://www.jamaicancaves.org/jamaica-dem.htm.
Data in this directory is organized as follows:
-|data
---|README.txt
---|Jamaica_demo.ini: Windows version configuration file.
---|hostfile: Hostfile for cluster usage.
---|dem
-----|Jamaica_dem.tif: The DEM of the study area as the only input file
-----|Jamaica_contour10.shp: The 10m contour shapefile for visualization.
---|output_fuzzy_slope_positions: Automated derived results
-----|FuzzySlpPos: Fuzzy slope position raster files.
-----|TypLoc: Typical locations (i.e., prototypes) of each slope position.
-----|Params: Automated derived topographic attribute from DEM.
-----|Config: Automated determined parameters for typical locations extraction and fuzzy inference.
-----|DinfpreDir: Preprocessing results, e.g., ridge sources and valley sources.
-----|Log: Log files including runtime information, etc.

Note: RDG: ridge; SHD: shoulder slope; BKS: backslope; FTS: footslope; VLY: valley.
